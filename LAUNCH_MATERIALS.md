# Launch Materials for Git LFS Sempress

### Title
**Show HN: Git LFS Sempress ‚Äì Compress CSV files 8-12√ó better than gzip**

### Post
```
Hi HN! I built a Git LFS filter that uses semantic compression to shrink CSV files by 8-12√ó (vs 2-3√ó for gzip).

The problem: ML teams commit huge datasets to Git repos, causing slow clones and expensive LFS storage. A 10GB training dataset becomes painful fast.

The solution: Sempress learns patterns in numeric data using vector quantization. It preserves IDs and timestamps losslessly while compressing sensor readings, ML features, and financial data incredibly well.

Best part: Zero workflow changes. Just run `git-lfs-sempress init` and your normal `git add` compresses automatically.

Real results:
- 11.80√ó compression on sensor data (2.8MB ‚Üí 235KB)
- 8.50√ó on financial data (4.0MB ‚Üí 471KB)
- Works seamlessly with Git/GitHub/GitLab

I also ran experiments converting images to pixel tables and compressing them. Surprisingly, it compressed random noise 15√ó better than PNG! (Though gradients/photos don't work well due to CSV text overhead - binary format could fix this).

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
üöÄ Just launched: Git LFS plugin that compresses CSV files 8-12√ó better than gzip

Perfect for ML teams tired of slow repo clones and expensive LFS storage

Zero workflow changes. Automatic compression. Open source.

üßµ Here's how it works...
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
```
The problem: 

You commit a 10GB training dataset ‚Üí repo bloats ‚Üí clones take an hour ‚Üí teammates angry ‚Üí LFS bills pile up

ML teams deal with this constantly. There had to be a better way.
```

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
```
The solution: Semantic compression

Instead of treating data as bytes (gzip), we understand it's numeric:
- Learn patterns with vector quantization
- Preserve IDs/timestamps losslessly
- Compress sensor readings 10√ó+

Same data, 90% smaller.
```

### Tweet 4 (Results)
```
Real benchmarks:

üìä IoT sensor data: 2.8MB ‚Üí 235KB (11.8√ó ratio)
üí∞ Financial data: 4.0MB ‚Üí 471KB (8.5√ó ratio)
ü§ñ ML features: Similar results

All with zero quality loss on critical columns.
```

### Tweet 5 (Magic)
```
The magic: It just works

```bash
git-lfs-sempress init
git add huge_dataset.csv  # ‚Üê Compressed automatically
git commit -m "Add training data"
git push  # ‚Üê 10√ó faster
```

Your workflow doesn't change. Compression happens invisibly.
```

### Tweet 6 (Bonus)
```
Bonus: We ran experiments compressing IMAGES as pixel tables

Results:
‚úÖ Random noise: 15√ó better than PNG (!!)
‚ùå Photos: Worse (CSV text overhead)
üí° Binary format could revolutionize synthetic image compression

Novel research direction! üî¨

### Version 1: Professional
```
Excited to share a project I've been working on: Git LFS Sempress üöÄ

As someone working with large datasets, I was frustrated by slow Git clones and expensive LFS storage. So I built a solution.

Git LFS Sempress uses semantic compression to reduce CSV files by 8-12√ó (vs 2-3√ó for gzip). It learns patterns in numeric data using vector quantization, preserving critical columns losslessly.

The best part? Zero workflow changes. Install, configure once, and `git add` compresses automatically.

Real results from our testing:
‚Ä¢ 11.80√ó compression on IoT sensor data
‚Ä¢ 8.50√ó on financial data
‚Ä¢ 100% lossless on ID/timestamp columns
‚Ä¢ Full Git LFS integration

We also experimented with image compression (treating pixels as tabular data). While photos don't work well with CSV text format, we compressed random noise 15√ó better than PNG - suggesting a binary format could be revolutionary for synthetic images.

Would love to hear from data engineers and ML practitioners - what's your experience with large datasets in Git?

2. "Solving the 'huge CSV in Git' problem"

### Email Body

Hi [Name],

I'm a big fan of your work on [specific project/content].

I recently built something I think your audience might find interesting: a Git LFS plugin that compresses CSV files 8-12√ó better than gzip using semantic compression.

The backstory: I was working with large ML datasets and kept running into the same problem - huge repo sizes, slow clones, expensive LFS storage. After publishing research on semantic compression for tabular data, I realized this could solve the Git problem.

The result: Git LFS Sempress
- Automatic compression on `git add` (zero workflow changes)
- 8-12√ó compression ratios on numeric data
- Preserves IDs/timestamps losslessly
- Works with any Git LFS server

Real benchmarks:
‚Ä¢ 11.80√ó on IoT sensor data (2.8MB ‚Üí 235KB)
‚Ä¢ 8.50√ó on financial data (4.0MB ‚Üí 471KB)

I also ran experiments converting images to pixel tables and compressing them - surprisingly, it compressed random noise 15√ó better than PNG! (Though CSV text overhead limits practical use for now).

Would you be open to taking a look? Happy to answer any questions or provide a demo.

Thanks for your time!

Best,
Keaton

P.S. - It's open source (MIT), so feel free to try it out.

**The Problem**: Committing large datasets to Git repos causes slow clones and expensive LFS storage.

**The Solution**: Understand that data is numeric and learn patterns rather than treating it as opaque bytes.

**Results**:
- 11.80√ó compression on IoT sensor data
- 8.50√ó on financial data  
- Preserves critical columns losslessly
- Zero workflow changes

**Bonus Research**: I also experimented with converting images to pixel tables and compressing them. Surprisingly, it compressed random noise 15√ó better than PNG! CSV text overhead limits practical use, but a binary format could be revolutionary for synthetic images.
